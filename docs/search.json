    "text": "Reflection on the Use of Generative AI\nGenerative AI was used in this project to support my learning rather than replace my own work. It helped me understand Quarto syntax, page structure, and media embedding, which allowed me to resolve issues independently.\nAI also guided my understanding of basic data visualization, particularly how to present numerical data clearly. However, decisions about content, layout, and interpretation were made by me.\nThere were limitations, as some AI suggestions were generic and required critical review to ensure they met assessment requirements. This highlighted the importance of human judgement.\nOverall, the project taught me how to use Generative AI responsibly as a learning aid to improve understanding and problem solving."
